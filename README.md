# Vizbud Travel Recommendation System

Welcome to the Vizbud project, a travel recommendation tool that enhances your vacation planning experience. This system is designed to suggest exciting points of interest for your next trip based on your social network's travel experiences. Whether you're seeking inspiration for your next adventure or looking for spots that align with your interests, Vizbud has got you covered.

## Introduction

Vizbud leverages data from the social media platform Gowalla to provide personalized travel recommendations. By analyzing your network connections and their travel preferences, Vizbud identifies cities and attractions that align with your interests. This project employs two distinct algorithms to achieve this goal:

### 1. Graph Mining

Our first approach employs Graph Mining to recommend cities and their associated attractions based on your social network. By identifying friends and friends of friends who share similar travel preferences, Vizbud uncovers destinations you'll love to explore.

### 2. Collaborative Filtering

The second approach, Collaborative Filtering, takes a broader perspective. It suggests attractions based on the preferences of users across the entire social media platform who closely match your travel interests.

### Combining Both Approaches

In our pursuit of precision, we also explore the possibility of combining both approaches to refine our recommendations further. The accuracy and effectiveness of this hybrid approach is thoroughly examined and explained in detail. This can be found within the notebook.

Your journey to discovering exciting new destinations begins here.
